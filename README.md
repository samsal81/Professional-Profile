## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this is a static website, there are no build steps or dependencies to install.

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samsal81/Professional-Profile.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html`:**
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. **(Optional) Serve with a Local Server:**
   For the best experience (and to avoid CORS issues if you add external assets later), use a simple server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```
